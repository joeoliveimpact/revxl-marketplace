## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- Initial release. Format engine #1 of the RevXL content family (shared analysis core bundled for now; splits out at format #2).
- **`onboarding`** — guided one-time setup: runtime + transcription-tier detection (yt-dlp captions floor + Groq / local faster-whisper), gate rule (captions + at least one real transcriber), bring-your-own-key SocialCrawl wiring with a client click-path, default beginner teach mode, state marker, and end-to-end verify.
- **`competitor-cross-reference`** — Instagram client-vs-competitor reel cross-reference → 10-section, client-facing strategy roadmap. Deterministic, regression-locked metrics engine; captions-first optional transcription (portable chain, no private infra).
- **`creator-strategy-harvest`** — harvest a trusted creator's full library (YouTube channel + playlists + newsletter) into a dated, recency-ruled, framework-extracted corpus for a knowledge vault (captions-first).
- **`reel-scripter`** — analysis-driven IG reel scripting: ranks proven niche moves from a cross-reference run and guides an in-voice Hook → Secondary → Body → Proof → CTA script with caption, flow-check, and craft scoring.
- **`/teach-mode`** command + shared teach-mode convention (`~/.claude/revxl/teach-mode`, `beginner` / `off`) — plain-English-first end-user voice by default, switchable.
- Skills chain forward: onboarding → competitor-cross-reference → reel-scripter.
